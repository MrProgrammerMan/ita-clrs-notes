# 1.1 Algorithms
An **algorithm** transforms values (input) into other values(output) in finite time. It does so through well-defined steps. It could be viewed as a tool for solving a problem defining an input/output relationship which the algorithm achieves, solving the problem.

A formal problem(the sorting problem):
**Input**: A sequence of numbers $<a_1, a_2, a_3 â€¦ a_n>$
**Output**: A permutation $<a'_1, a'_2, a'_3 ... a'_n>$ of the input sequence such that $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le ... \le a_n$.

An **input sequence**, say, $<12, 65, 23, 2, 5, 8>$ is called an **instance** of the sorting problem.
Sorting if often an intermidiary step in computer problems and is extremely common.

An algorithm is considered **correct** and to be a **solution** to a sorting problem if it provides the correct solution in finite time for every provided problem instance.
