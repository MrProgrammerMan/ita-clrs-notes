# Notes for Introduction to Algorithms, 4th edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
This repository is a collection of notes for the book [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/). It is written, and intended to be viewed in Zettlr, a markdown writing and management tool. The files contain internal Zettlr links made to make the contents easy to browse.

## Methodology
The notes in this repo is organized somewhat as a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). This is a new technique to me, and so I probably won't do it perfectly. There will likely be some disorganization and mistakes.

## Purpose
The reason I want to make this repo is that I want a solid grasp on the complex and large topics of algorithms. I believe this is very important in order to properly understand higher level patterns of software engineering and when to use which. More generally, I wish to develop a personal knowledge base that I'm intimately familiar with for this topic. I wish to become better at organizing my work and learning. I've always been terrible at writing notes, and so I want to put some work into organizing my notetaking. in working with this topic(and the aforementioned book) in this way, I will also develop a reference that I can use in the future.
